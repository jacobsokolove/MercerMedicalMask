Reusable 3D printed face mask

Mercer School of Engineering faculty and students have been working to fabricate reusable 3D printed face masks for use by medical professionals in locations where PPE supplies, such as N95 masks, have been depleted by the sharp increase in patient numbers (**link to earlier press release).  

Today, Dr. Joanna Thomas and Mercer engineering student Jacob Sokolove, with the help of Coliseum Medical Center physicians and nurses, put their mask prototype through a fit test (https://www.osha.gov/video/respiratory_protection/fittesting_transcript.html) to confirm its effectiveness.  

The prototype passed with flying colors so Mercer plans to move forward fabricating masks and distributing to medical facilities and medical practitioners that have indicated a need for alternative PPE as a stop gap measure for employees until FDA approved PPE becomes available again. A link to more information on the mask materials and the mask STL files is located below.     

**This masks was designed with efficacy and the wearerâ€™s safety in mind. We selected materials we believe to be biocompatible based on available product data sheets; however, these masks are not FDA tested or approved and Mercer cannot guarantee their efficacy or safety. Anyone who fabricates these or similar masks and/or wears the masks we produce does so at their own risk.
